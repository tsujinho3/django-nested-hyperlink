# Django Nested Hyperlink for Django REST Framework

## How to start

You need Docker. When you install docker, you can start development with
```
bash docker-up.sh
```
And we allow `-n, --no-build` option to skip the build phase. This option is useful when you are not on the Internet.

Now, you are in the shell. Migrations for test are finished. You can test the code immediately using the Django's test server.
```
python3 manage.py runserver 0:8000
```
